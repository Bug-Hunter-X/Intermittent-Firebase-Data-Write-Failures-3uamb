# Intermittent Firebase Data Write Failures in Firebase

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when writing data to a Firebase Realtime Database.  Despite seemingly correct code and error handling, data writes were intermittently failing. This issue is reproduced and solved in this repository.

## Bug Description
Data was written to the Firebase database using the standard `set()` method. However, instead of a consistent write, the operation would occasionally fail without any apparent reason. Network connectivity was confirmed to be stable, and error handling within the code was correctly implemented. This led to data inconsistencies and unreliable application behavior.

## Solution
The root cause is often related to security rules or rate limits enforced by the Firebase service.  While the code might appear flawless, an overlooked aspect in the rules or exceeding the allowed requests per second can result in intermittent write failures.

The solution presented involves reviewing security rules to check that they allow the write action for the authenticated user and implementing rate limiting to control the amount of write operation calls.
